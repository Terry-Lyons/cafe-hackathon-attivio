- lib -- Use this directory for any library files that the project needs. 
They will be added to the classpath in order for their classes to 
be available.

- lib-override -- Use this directory for any library files to that need to override 
existing AIE libraries. They will appear earlier in the classpath than 
the existing libraries and any classes they contain will be used instead 
of those in the existing libraries.

- resources -- You can add any additional resources (dictionaries, ontologies, etc.) 
to this directory and they will be copied to the individual AIE servers 
when the project is deployed.
